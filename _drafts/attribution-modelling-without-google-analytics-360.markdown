Google's Data-Driven Attribution is a feature only available in
Google Analytics 360, part of Google Marketing Platform. Rather than using the

your Google Analytics account to generate a custom model, driven by a more
sophisticated algorithm.

The algorithm used in Data-Driven Attribution is based on a concept called the
Shapley Value, which is from the field of cooperative game theory
