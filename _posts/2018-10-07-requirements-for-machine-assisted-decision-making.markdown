What do you need to know to make the decisions?

How do you value differ outcomes and errors? No prediction is 100% accurate.
So, in order to determine the value of investing in better prediction, you need
to know the cost of taking the course of action based on the output of the ML

What are you trying to do?

An action leads to an outcome: What are your metrics for task success?

Is the data fit for purpose to run the Machine Learning algorithms?  Usually,
pre-processing is required to be done, there will be extra charges

Machine Learning improvements come from feedback data. This is data that you
collect when the prediction machine is operating in real situations.
Feedback data is often generated from a richer set of environments than
training data.
