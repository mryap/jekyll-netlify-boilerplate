> Recruitment is in the rejection industry

The journey begins when my job application for digital marketing/data analyst role in handful of SaaS got rejected last 2 weeks.  [Similar story](https://www.thinkbusiness.ie/articles/alan-coleman-wolfgang-digital) last week also spurred me on.

This is my response.

I had several goals: 
- Turn data analytics task into a product. This part is solely lacking in the NCI HDSDA course
- Use a new piece of technology. I chose to use Docker 
- Build a product and market it: Both experience were deemed I do not possess 
- Make it open source, and learn how to use Git and GitHub
- Serve as a proof of concept
- Document my learning journey
- Serve as a portfolio to showcase when I applied for a job, course
