I used to have a personal site blog with domain name getoptimise dot com

My failure not to renew on times means someone bought it and I have to fork out  
absence amount to get it back. I always have the impression that domain name not
renew will be 'back to the pool' again and I can buy it back.
It appears there are people who standby and snag them when you did not renew
on time.

# My lost is a gain in knowledge

While it not critical for me that the domain name is lost. I want to get myself
familiar with the process so I can advise my client or future employer.

I briefly check out other domain extension. Namely, .CO, .ME and .IO

I learnt that there are lot of options open up when you go with `.CO`
I test it verbally with a family members not working in the internet industry
who are not active on Social Media. I learn that she automatically complete
`.CO` with `.UK` as in `.co.uk` or `.com` adding an M at the back of `.CO`

# What I really want

I want a domain name that catchy and at a first glance reflect what I do -
Digital Analytics. A domain suggest work that involves numbers.  

I also consider paring my family name with .ME but sounds so weird.

What I do not want is when I put down the domain name which is also my trade name,
people out of habit ends it with .com and google it and bring them to someone
website.
